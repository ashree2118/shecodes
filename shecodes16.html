    <p> Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other
        medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"[1] or "support").The medium is commonly applied to the base
        with
        a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, may be used.

        In art, the term "painting" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a
        painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer,
        pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including
        sand,
        clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.</p>
